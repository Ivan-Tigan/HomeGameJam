# HomeGameJam
Attic Dash <br>
This is a game that was made for the 2019 Global Game Jam on the theme of 'Home". <br>
Made in Unity.<br>
The programming was done in C# by me.<br>
There were 4 other members in the team and they were responsible for the art (2D and 3D), the music and sound effects, and the game design.
